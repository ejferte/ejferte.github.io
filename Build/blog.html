        <h2>What challenges did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h1>
        <p>I struggled setting up multiple folders within my files when uploading to a web format, making my links properly link to the right pages.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
        <p>I learned the barebones of html and how to use git, I had never used either before so it took some time to get the hang of but I feel a lot more confident with it now.</p>
        <h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h3>
        <p>Rewatching some of the lectures going over the html was helpful, when first attending the lecture it was hard to see where I would use something but once I started working through it
            I was able to see where I might need something and I would go back to the lecture video and see how to properly use something.
