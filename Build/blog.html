        <h2>What challenges did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>
        <p>I struggled with the git stuff early on but eventually got the hang of it and realized I needed to make a new repo to get github pages working.</p>
        <p>Once I got that figued out the only thing I really struggled with from there was organizing my files within the web format, I wanted to separate each assignment to its own folder.</p>
        <p>It took some fiddling but I eventually got it setup and got my hyperlinks to link where I wanted them to.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
        <p>I learned the barebones of html and how to use git, I had never used either before so it took some time to get the hang of but I feel a lot more confident with it now.</p>
        <p>Things I already knew were next to none, I had never used or seen html, and didn't even have a github account prior to this assignment.</p>
        <h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
        <p>Rewatching some of the lectures going over the html was helpful, when first attending the lecture it was hard to see where I would use something but once I started working through it</p>
        <p>I was able to see where I might need something and I would go back to the lecture video and see how to properly use something.</p>
