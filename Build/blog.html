        <h1>Blog 1 - 4/12/2021</h1>
        <h2>What challenges did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>
            <p>I struggled with the git stuff early on but eventually got the hang of it and realized I needed to make a new repo to get github pages working.</p>
            <p>Once I got that figued out the only thing I really struggled with from there was organizing my files within the web format, I wanted to separate each assignment to its own folder.</p>
            <p>It took some fiddling but I eventually got it setup and got my hyperlinks to link where I wanted them to.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>
            <p>I learned the barebones of html and how to use git, I had never used either before so it took some time to get the hang of but I feel a lot more confident with it now.</p>
            <p>Things I already knew were next to none, I had never used or seen html, and didn't even have a github account prior to this assignment.</p>
        <h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>
            <p>Rewatching some of the lectures going over the html was helpful, when first attending the lecture it was hard to see where I would use something but once I started working through it</p>
            <p>I was able to see where I might need something and I would go back to the lecture video and see how to properly use something.</p>
        
        <h1>Blog 2 - 4/26/2021</h1>
        <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
            <p>I struggled with getting the background of my header to set but then I realized I was trying to style it as a class when it was not a class. (I had it as .header instead of header)</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
            <p>I learned the basics of styling in CSS and the importance of using a stylesheet and how it makes making adjustments to the styling of a website so much easier when you can just go change a few lines and the entire page changes.</p>
        <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
            <p>StackOverflow was helpful in getting started on my stylesheet, I typically turned to that before rewatching lectures as it was easier than having to skip through lectures looking for exactly what I was dealing with.</p>
        <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
            <p>I had to google something for the font weightings when trying to match the fonts from the mocks to my styling.</p>

        <h1>Blog 3 - 5/09/2021</h1>
        <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
            <p>I struggled getting the search bar working, it took some digging to find a solution, I asked around in the classroom forum and someone eventually pointed to what my problem was and that got me headed in the right place and I eventually go it working.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about javascript and its interactions with html and css. What I knew was some of the similarities between javascript and C++ specifically for-loops.</p>
        <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
            <p>I used the campuswire forum, lecture slides, and a lot of google, specifically StackOverflow.</p>
        <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
            <p>I had to google a lot of things to get the flex boxes to disappear when getting the active-searching working. Finding the functionality of "content[i].closest(".twit").classList.add("hidden");" took awhile but once I got it working it made a lot of sense.</p>
