        <h1>Blog 2 - 4/26/2021</h1>
        <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
            <p>I struggled with getting the background of my header to set but then I realized I was trying to style it as a class when it was not a class. (I had it as .header instead of header)</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
            <p>I learned the basics of styling in CSS and the importance of using a stylesheet and how it makes making adjustments to the styling of a website so much easier when you can just go change a few lines and the entire page changes.</p>
        <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
            <p>StackOverflow was helpful in getting started on my stylesheet, I typically turned to that before rewatching lectures as it was easier than having to skip through lectures looking for exactly what I was dealing with.</p>
        <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
            <p>I had to google something for the font weightings when trying to match the fonts from the mocks to my styling.</p>
