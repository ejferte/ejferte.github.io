        <h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
            <p>I struggled getting the search bar working, it took some digging to find a solution, I asked around in the classroom forum and someone eventually pointed to what my problem was and that got me headed in the right place and I eventually go it working.</p>
        <h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about javascript and its interactions with html and css. What I knew was some of the similarities between javascript and C++ specifically for-loops.</p>
        <h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
            <p>I used the campuswire forum, lecture slides, and a lot of google, specifically StackOverflow.</p>
        <h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
            <p>I had to google a lot of things to get the flex boxes to disappear when getting the active-searching working. Finding the functionality of "content[i].closest(".twit").classList.add("hidden");" took awhile but once I got it working it made a lot of sense.</p>
